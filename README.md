## üìå Background
Through SQL queries, I sought to answer these key questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?**
2Ô∏è‚É£ **What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?**
3Ô∏è‚É£ **What skills are most in demand for data analysts?**
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Which skills are associated with higher salaries?**
5Ô∏è‚É£ **What are the most optimal skills to learn?**

## üõ† Tools Used
- **SQL**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git & GitHub**

## üìä The Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
üìå **Insight:** This query identifies the highest-paying data analyst jobs by filtering out roles with missing salary data and sorting by salary.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Skills Required for Top-Paying Jobs
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10  
)
SELECT top_paying_jobs.*, skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```
üìå **Insight:** Lists the most common skills required for the highest-paying data analyst jobs.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
üìå **Insight:** Highlights the top 5 most in-demand skills for data analysts.



---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Skills Associated with Higher Salaries
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS AVERAGE_SALARY
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY AVERAGE_SALARY DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
üìå **Insight:** Determines which skills lead to higher salaries in data analytics.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Most Optimal Skills to Learn
```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY skills_dim.skill_id
),
AVERAGE_SALARY AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS AVERAGE_SALARY
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY skills_dim.skill_id
)
SELECT
    sd.skill_id,  
    sd.skills,
    sd.demand_count,
    avg_sal.AVERAGE_SALARY  
FROM skills_demand AS sd
INNER JOIN AVERAGE_SALARY AS avg_sal ON sd.skill_id = avg_sal.skill_id;
```
üìå **Insight:** Identifies the skills that have both high demand and high salary potential.
